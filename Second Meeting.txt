7/2/2024 Meeting

Important Notes:
	- Make sure statements are in per capita terms.
	- Do not assume that submarkets with the most inventory in 2010 had the most new units in 2023
	- More inventory per capita is a negative predictor of how much new stock was build by 2023 (city level)
	- Area hierarchy: Metro area (DFW) -> Municipality/city (Dallas) -> Submarket (Yardi-defined) -> Census tract
	
Questions:
	- *** Where is the affordable housing in these cities? ***
		- Where is AFF currently?
		- Where is AFF being built?
	- Is there a simple variable that can explain where AFF housing goes/is going?
	- Is it true that, across localities, AFF housing is concentrated in poor/low income areas?

Steps for Research:
1. Get ACS data.
	- Select relevant variables.
	- DP02, DP03, DP04
2. Aggregate census data to the submarket level.
	- Make sure everything is in per capita terms. 
	- Example: Number of AFF units per capita.
3. Make statements about submarkets.
	- What predicts where inventory is?
	- What predicts where new inventory goes?
4. Make statements about cities.
	- Aggregate submarket data.
	- The cities chosen for this research represent about 20% of the American population.
5. Group the submarkets into 3-4 bins per city.
	- Example: Rank the bins by most affordable -> least affordable sectors of a city.
	- Put on a map, color code by income.
6. Compare cities to each other.
7. Make maps!
	- One of the last steps. We should have all other data/stats/information first.
	- Example of slide:
		- 2 maps of Dallas	
			1. Color coded submarkets by income
			2. Color coded submarkets by available AFF units
8. Get attention!!
	- Ranking cities
	- Example: Rank cities by most likely to have AFF in poor areas to least likely
