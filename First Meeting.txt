Logic of project
- Value in assembling a descriptive set of data for nuanced topics
- If we get to a place where we say about 40 submarkets/neighborhoods
	- Where is the housing and where is the inventory located?
	- Where are the new ones being added?
- Once we have census tracts,
	- Download from ACS facts about the neighborhood
	- Can discover more qualitative qualities of the neighborhood
	- Can predict why there is more/less housing in the neighborhood
- Then, we can
	- Make statements about the entire municipality (Dallas, with 26 submarkets)
	- Come up with intuitive statements about the whole city
		- "How much affordable housing per capita in diff submarkets, how does it correlate with metrics like income, racial constituion"
		- Eventually can compare all municipalities
			- "High correlation between income and affordable housing" for example
			- Try to keep it simple with the statements
			- "Of these cities, x is the most segregated"
- Once we have municipality data
	- Is the data at the level of the whole municipality/locality?
	- Characteristics of the whole place that has predictors for segregation level? Is segregation predictive of other things?
	- Relationships between relatively high/low segregation levels (aff housing in poor areas) and 
	- How much aff housing was built at all compared to segregation levels?
	
Structure of the data (what does the spreadsheet look like)
- For any one submarket, we have 
	- Disregard WF and MR
		- In the raw data, every year was a row and each subset of housing was split into four
		- "Market rate" = They are charging a rate that is not regulated/controlled; set by supply and demand
	- Fully affordable housing
		- The government has a direct hand in making the rents lower (government controlled)
	- WF + MR
		- Aimed at the middle of the population
		
Background information
- Who qualifies for fully affordable?
	- Income based
		- Federal Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) has a separate income distribution from the census
		- Level of areas (could be single city, county, etc)
		- Area Median Income
			- Regardless of true distribution, define key levels of income (30% of AMI, 50%, 60%, 80%, 120%)
			- Below 30% = extremely poor, difficult to house
			- Near 80% = decently well served
	- Looking at income distribution, somewhere between bottom 30-40% would qualify
- In every submarket, # of midrange unit way more than AFF units
	- # of families who qualify is way more
	- People who would qualify for AFF live in "naturally occurring affordable housing"
		- Units get old & run down
		- Was never subject to government regulation, but as building ages, value declines and becomes "kind of" affordable
		- Distinction impossible for this project
	- Too few AFF units to meet need
	
ACS (American Community Survey)
- Where in these cities is the existing AFF, and where are they building new AFF?
	- Look at both AFF and WF+MR
	- More people who qualify for AFF are living in WF+MR than AFF

Basic problem:
- What we have from Yardi is doing what the fed gov is not.
	- Counting units (census of apartments in US) and updating it once a year down to submarket levels
	- Does not collect data from humans
		- No income, age, gender, race, etc
- Combining Yardi data with fed gov data
- Want to speak to apartment characteristics and human characteristics

Our goal:
- Take the Yardi map & submarkets, and cross-walk the 26 submarkets to a list of census tracts
- The census tract lines will not perfectly fit.
	- Can follow any rule as long as it is consistent
	- Recommendation: Eyeball it. More than 1/2 of census tract inside the submarket, assign it to that submarket
	
Once census tracts are assigned,
	1. Download data from ACS
		- May have NAs in census tract data due to nonresponse
		- For each submarket, enter all relevant census tracts.
			- DP02, DP03, DP04 reports
			- 3 reports x 2 periods of time
				- 2022 5-year, 2010 5-year
	2. Combine all census tract data in a submarket
		- Can do with simple addition
		
* Important thing * 
- Turn Yardi numbers into per capita numbers
- Census tracts are not the same size

What variables do we need from the ACS reports?
- Will not need all variables from the reports

* Why? *
What places in the sun belt area performing the best and what is causing the performance?
